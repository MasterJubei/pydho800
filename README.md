![A Rigol DHO800 setup](/doc/dhophoto.jpg)

A simple Python library and utility to control and query data from
Rigol DHOxxx oscilloscopes (not supporting all features of the oscilloscope,
work in progress). This library implements the [Oscilloscope](https://github.com/tspspi/pylabdevs/blob/master/src/labdevices/oscilloscope.py) class from
the [pylabdevs](https://github.com/tspspi/pylabdevs) package which
exposes the public interface.

## Installing 

There is a PyPi package that can be installed using

```
pip install pydho800
```

## Simple example to fetch waveforms:

```python
from dho800.dho800 import DHO800

with DHO800(address = "10.0.0.123") as dho:
   print(f"Identify: {dho.identify()}")

   dho.set_channel_enable(0, True)
   dho.set_channel_enable(1, True)

   data = dho.query_waveform((0, 1))
   print(data)

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   plt.plot(data['x'], data['y0'], label = "Ch1")
   plt.plot(data['x'], data['y1'], label = "Ch2")
   plt.show()
```

Note that ```numpy``` usage is optional for this implementation.
One can enable numpy support using ```useNumpy = True``` in the
constructor.

## Querying additional statistics

This module allows - via the ```pylabdevs``` base class to query
additional statistics:

* ```mean``` Calculates the mean values and standard deviations
   * A single value for each channels mean at ```["means"]["yN_avg"]```
     and a single value for each standard deviation at ```["means"]["yN_std"]```
     where ```N``` is the channel number
* ```fft``` runs Fourier transform on all queried traces
   * The result is stored in ```["fft"]["yN"]``` (complex values) and
     in ```["fft"]["yN_real"]``` for the real valued Fourier transform.
     Again ```N``` is the channel number
* ```ifft``` runs inverse Fourier transform on all queried traces
   * Works as ```fft``` but runs the inverse Fourier transform and stores
     its result in ```ifft``` instead of ```fft```
* ```correlate``` calculates the correlation between all queried
  waveform pairs.
   * The result of the correlations are stored in ```["correlation"]["yNyM"]```
     for the correlation between channels ```M``` and ```N```
* ```autocorrelate``` performs calculation of the autocorrelation of each
  queried channel.
   * The result of the autocorrelation is stored in ```["autocorrelation"]["yN"]```
     for channel ```N```

To request calculation of statistics pass the string for the
desired statistic or a list of statistics to the ```stats```
parameter of ```query_waveform```:

```python
with DHO800(address = "10.0.0.123") as dho:
	data = dho.query_waveform((1,2), stats = [ 'mean', 'fft' ])
```
